This is a python port of a ruby port of arc90's readability project

http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/

Given a html document, it pulls out the main body text and cleans it up.

Ruby port by starrhorne and iterationlabs
Python port by gfxmonk

This port uses BeautifulSoup for the HTML parsing. That means it can be
a little slow, but will work on Google App Engine (unlike libxml-based
libraries)


**note**: I don't currently have any plans for using or improving this
library, and it's far from perfect (slow, and almost certainly buggy).
So if you do something cool with it or have a better tool that does
the same job, please let me know and I can link to it from here.

If you're looking for alternatives / forks, here's the list so far:
